# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

  Week started off really intimidating. Going from for loops to the forEach => was a LOT harder than i would have liked for my brain to grasp it. But I'm feeling very confident in my ability to use them now.

   Was shocked at how many easier ways there are to manipulate as well as format your code, using parameters in functions for example. I feel like i still struggle with completely writing out javascript without constantly looking at references, but i DEFINITELY feel like i am getting a lot better at it.

    Partner coding this week really helped me to talk out what i need to do and use my brain to think of what we need to do instead of always alt tabbing into notes. 
    
    I would count my ability to confidently be able to write out some basic functions without needing my notes. Being able to actually think through a function and how it needs to work and making it my own way instead of looking at references and trying to copy that function into my function.
