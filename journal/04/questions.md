# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Asynchronous code does tasks concurrently and allows the code to continue running while waiting for other tasks to be done. Synchronous code is just being read top to bottom. or in a SEQUENCE.  |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | allows you to run code or do things on certain events, the event listener looks for these events and then runs whatever code you specify for it to. So like a button, or form submit, ect. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | rest stands for REpresantational State Transfer, Which means resource-based: meaning its the building blocks or fundamentals of REST. Hence the '-based' part. Stateless communications: meaning each request contains all the necessary information for the request. Client-Serve Architecture: seperating the concerns of the client and server. (makes it easier to scale) CRUD OPERATIONS: using standard HTTP methods which are easily understood.(create, read, update, delete) and Uniform Interface: using common practices found in the industry. I.E. appropriate status codes and resprsentations of resources. |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback is a function thats passed as an argument to another function. A higher order function can accept or return multiple functions as arguments alowing us to use them like any other data type.  |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is an object that represents the asychronous code either completing or not. A try catch is a great way to capture an error from a promise, could probably also use if else statements as well i imagine. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Get, post, put, delete |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | ANSWER HERE |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | Async the function |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | To bundle like data together. good practice for object orientated programming. Makes it easier to trouble shoot if something goes wrong. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | Bad request |
