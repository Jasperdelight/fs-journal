# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?

    > | So we can easily collaborate and share code making it easier to access for ourselves and others |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?

    > | Make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

    > | Pseudo-classes add special functionality to certain elements, letting you apply style to an element in relation to the document as well as other factors. I believe button:hover will be used a lot for UI/UX things, and i imagine a bunch of pseudo classes will be used for any input element. |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

    > | specificity determines which rules should be applied when there are multiple rules targeting the same element/property but they have different values, it would be beneficial if you only want to select one element to change when you have multiple of the same elements. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

    > | nothing will become important and then when you try to use the feature it won't do anything, it will also mess with other things specificity |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | selector, property, value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    > | Good design makes the whole user experience more enjoyable, making them not dreading to return to that site to navigate it, they may even enjoy it if it's fancy enough ðŸ˜Š. You could convey many things through design alone, it not only reflects the well on the owner of the website but also whoever made that website. I know if a website looks very sketchy and poorly designed/ optimized I personally am much more likely to stay away from it. You can also convey information in a way you want or that's more relevant to that particular content. I.E. youtubes website design for videos compared to use a website model like ,idk, gmail to browse videos. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

    > | To rough draft your webpage or app to get an overview of the layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality and intended layout. Basically to just get a idea of what you want your page to do as well as the basics on how it will look|

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

    > | Depending on the project yes, if it's something simple that doesn't take much effort wireframing may not be needed. But it's great to do if you have time or are working on any type of collaboration project or something that will have a lot of functionality or moving parts. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`

    > | It allows you to move content inline, and give the content many other properties allowing it to easily move around the page. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | width, height, padding, and even border i suppose. |
