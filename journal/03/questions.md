# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism|

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | export is used for exporting multiple named entities, while export default is used for a single default entity. Both use different syntax while importing as well. |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | The idea of bundling data and functions or methods i guess they would be called, that use the data together within an object. Part of OOP. Helps hide data.|

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | They help hide sensitive data as well as making it unable to access the data by throwing errors and other things to the console. |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | A class is a blueprint for an object while the instance of the class would be a created object from that blueprint. So like in our model pages we have our class constructor. Then in our appstate would be where we hold the instances of that class. |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | It allows you to define properties of an object by using math or functions. Done with [] |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | To keep big projects more organized for easier trouble shooting as well protecting data and other functions. Data is more safe and harder to manipulate by only exporting/importing certain information on certain ones. Better scalABILITY, maintainABILITY, testABILITY, and reusABILITY! |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | Acts as the 'waiter' between the model/appstate/service and the view. Relays information to the Service. |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The service is in charge of taking the information from the controller and changing values or other things with that information. Acts as the middle man between the controller and the "data" |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The model is the where the data is stored and the also holds our class constructors and other data. |
